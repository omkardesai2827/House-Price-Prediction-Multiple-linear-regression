# House Price Prediction Multiple linear regression
## I have created three models using linear regression, lasso regression and ridge regression.

## I have compared all models using pycaret library and it shows the lasso and ridge regression models are the best among all.

## The pycaret codes for comparison are on the google colab notebook
